// Some of the member function of List:
// begin( ): It returns an iterator pointing to the first element in list.Its time complexity is O(1). 
// end( ): It returns an iterator referring to the theoretical element(doesnâ€™t point to an element) which follows the last element.Its time complexity is O(1). 
// empty( ): It returns whether the list is empty or not.It returns 1 if the list is empty otherwise returns 0.Its time complexity is O(1). 
// assign( ): It assigns new elements to the list by replacing its current elements and change its size accordingly.It time complexity is O(N).
// back( ): It returns reference to the last element in the list.Its time complexity is O(1). 
// erase( ): It removes a single element or the range of element from the list.Its time complexity is O(N). 
// front( ): It returns reference to the first element in the list.Its time complexity is O(1). 
// push_back( ): It adds a new element at the end of the list, after its current last element. Its time complexity is O(1). 
// push_front( ): It adds a new element at the beginning of the list, before its current first element. Its time complexity is O(1). 
// remove( ): It removes all the elements from the list, which are equal to given element. Its time complexity is O(N). 
// pop_back( ): It removes the last element of the list, thus reducing its size by 1. Its time complexity is O(1). 
// pop_front( ): It removes the first element of the list, thus reducing its size by 1. Its time complexity is O(1). 
// insert( ): It insert new elements in the list before the element on the specified position. Its time complexity is O(N). 
// reverse ( ): It reverses the order of elements in the list. Its time complexity is O(N). 
// size( ): It returns the number of elements in the list. Its time complexity is O(1).
